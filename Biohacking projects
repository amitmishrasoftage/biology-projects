Biohacking projects involve DIY biology experiments, modifications, or innovations often conducted by enthusuasts, scientists, or hobbyists within the field of biology. These projects can range from personal experiments to community-driven 
initiatives aimed at exploring, understanding, or modifying biological systems. Here are some examples of biohacking projects :

1. DIY Lab equipment : building low-cost laboratory equipment such as centrifuges, PCR machines, or incubators using accessible materials and open-source designs to make scientific experimentation more affordable and accessible.

2. Bioinformatics and data analysis : engaging in bioinformatics projects that involve analyzing biological data, DNA sequences, or genomes using open-source software and databases to explore genetic variations, evolutionary relationships, or
disease associations.

3. DIY genetic engineering : conducting genetic engineering experiments with microorganisms or plants by introducing genes using CRISPR technology or other gene-editing tools to explore genetic variations, evolutionary relationships, or disease
associations.
